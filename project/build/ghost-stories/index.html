    <p>This old-fashioned horror anthology isn’t terrifying or
    scream-inducing; instead, it’s closer in spirit to the
    moody, clammy, atmospheric English movies of decades past,
    and parodies thereof. I am again reminded of Dr.
    Strangelove.</p>
    <h2>The UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA)</h2>
    <p>Beginning of 2018, <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/30/uk-mass-digital-surveillance-regime-ruled-unlawful-appeal-ruling-snoopers-charter">the
    European Court of Justice ruled that the UK’s Snooper’s
    Charter is unlawful</a>. In 2018, Australia’s parliament
    passed legislation that allows intelligence and law
    enforcement agencies to demand access to encrypted
    communications data. And the GCHQ now wantsss that
    preciousss information too. Secure messaging platforms such
    as WhatsApp and iMessage can be forced to create backdoors
    or to operate a “ghost protocol” that “CC’s” an encrypted
    message to a third-party when it is sent. A state run
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)?!?</p>
    <p>The ghastly ghostly proposal from GCHQ was made late 2018
    by its director Ian Levy, and involved “silently adding a
    law enforcement participant to a group chat or call”,
    according to the <a
    href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">“Principles
    for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate” article</a>
    written by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson.</p>
    <h2>The Letter</h2>
    <p>Then a coalition of 47 organisations and individuals wrote
    to the GCHQ, raising objections to the proposal to insert
    privileged users in encrypted conversations, in order for
    the government to spy on such interactions without actually
    breaking encryption. The GCHQ “ghost protocol” would
    seriously undermine user security and trust. O Really?!?</p>
    <p>And while I do think it is an excellent idea to bring it to
    the table, among the signets are also Apple and Facebook’s
    WhatsUp.</p>
    <p>Ironically, Facebook is the biggest and worst example of
    how business models arrogate and appropriate data about us,
    read all our emails, comments, and other things we put
    online and behind the scenes with friends, family, business
    connections, in order that this content might be tied into
    our profiles and make us easier targets for their paying
    customers – the advertisers and marketers of big and small
    organisations – to drill down into our inner desires and
    close that all important sale. And Apple continues to give
    the impression it thinks privacy is worth fighting for, even
    if only as a business Unique Selling Point.</p>
    <p>The intrusive activities and long-term business models of
    “data science” are Silicon Valley’s very own(ed) ghost
    protocol.</p>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
