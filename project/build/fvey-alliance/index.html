<p>The UKUSA agreement, first called the BRUSA
Agreement, was signed in March 1946 for
cooperation in signals intelligence between
the UK and the USA. It was extended to include
Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand
in 1956. It was a secret agreement until 1999
when it was disclosed by the Australian
Defence Signals Directorate.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s called the Five Eyes (FVEY).
On June 25, 2010, the <a
href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukusa/">full
text of the agreement</a> was publicly
released by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Created to share signals intelligence between
allies, the agreement has streamlined the
collection and analysis of intercepted data
and communications. There is thought to be
around 130 known listening stations worldwide.
Some are huge, such as Britain’s Menwith Hill
complex, and some are small or even “internet
of things”-size small and function
automatically. The agreement standardises
terminology, codes, clearances, handling
procedures and access to facilities. An
exchange of personnel appears common.</p>
<p>Governments of the UKUSA members have been
careful to seem to restrain their agencies
from spying on their own citizens in
politician and watchdog words and very clear
laws, but nothing keeps the other members of
the agreement from spying on their partners’
citizens and handing over that information as
part of the intelligence sharing agreement.
Not only that, apparently intelligence
agencies are above such laws, and the laws are
updated, upgraded and adapted to the actual
capacities of intelligence agencies, not the
other way around.</p>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
