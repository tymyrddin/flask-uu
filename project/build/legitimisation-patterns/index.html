<h1>Legitimisation patterns</h1>

Legitimate power is based on a structural relationship (or rather
the acceptance of economic stratification or other forms of
hierarchy) between the influencing agent and the target.
Implicitly, or explicitly, the agent says, “I have a right (the
position) to ask you to do this and you have an obligation (the
position) to comply”.<br>
</p>
<p>When words like “obliged” or “obligated”, “should”, “ought to”,
“must”, and “are required to” are used, they may signal an
attempt at “legitimisation of power” (which even if accepted by
a society, may not be considered lawful in more common sense
perceptions or by a questioning individual).</p>
<p>Legitimacy can be understood as a capital of recognition
(Bourdieu). This symbolic capital makes a coercive force be
accepted for whom it “suffers”. Power becomes authority when it
possesses “capital of legitimisation”. However, bearing in mind
that throughout political history of the West that capital of
legitimacy has function and has been stated in diverse ways,
this distinction between power and authority must take in the
multiple and diverse forms in which both have been conceived.
There are mainly three legitimacy paradigms that can synthesize
the earlier mentioned history: the paradigm of difference, that
of equality, and that of interdependency between difference and
equality. Each one of these paradigms entails different ways of
conceiving the legitimate power and the illegitimate power:</p>
<ul>
<li>within difference the legitimate power is the sacred force
owned by the sovereign over the subordinate who lacks power
(since the illegitimate power lacks formulation it can only be
conceived as a resistant practice).</li>
<li>within equality the legitimate power is the determination of
the collection of equals (system, nation, society, …) over
oneself, it is the self-created or emerging domain from a
systemic collection of relations, while the illegitimate and
subjective power splits up, fragments or scatters the whole,
and at the same time progresses producing “illegitimacy”.</li>
<li>within interdependence the power assimilates the tension
between potential (possibility) and force in action, all power
and all authority is conceived as disintegrating and
subjective, a degree of recognition between different ones who
do not give up difference and who recognize themselves on it
as equally strongly linked in interdependency webs where the
possibility of better balanced relationships appears.</li>
</ul>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
