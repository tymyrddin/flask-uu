    </div>

    <div class="blogpost__article">
        
    <p>From a scenario planning done in 2013, with some of the measurables and observables that had appeared by 2022:</p>
    <h2>Obliviousness and congruence</h2>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>In scenario planning everything is a prediction. None of it is
    real. All predictions are wrong. And that which gets overlooked
    in most (if not all) digital scenarios is reality. For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>We belong to a finite planet, with finite resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Likely effects</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Constraints on economic development (but not for
    transnational players in the neoliberal network).</li>
    <li>Corporations and businesses already show a trend of making
    employees make do with what they have and requests made by
    employees for better resources (to serve customers with) are
    ignored, leaving employees in a very difficult place – unable
    to do their job properly and on top of that, likely to be
    penalised for ‘poor performance’. This could lead to people
    feeling burned out and frustrated. Performance will drop as a
    result and so will demand and profits.</li>
    <li>Instead of dealing with it (just as with addicts facing a
    scarcity of the resource they are dependent on), over-use of
    resources, such as the depletion of rain forests and
    over-fishing can occur.</li>
    <li>Opportunism can increase.</li>
    <li>Misuse of scarce resources is also likely.</li>
    <li>The effect of inflation tends to be stronger for low-income
    individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more
    vulnerable, thereby increasing inequality.</li>
    <li>Lack of material resources - chronic (low income) and
    situational (inflation) lack of material resources - causes
    people to make harsher moral judgments and be more (often)
    physically ill.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Measurables and observables</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Many of the metals needed to feed the surging global demand
    for high-tech products, from smartphones to solar panels,
    cannot be replaced, according to a Yale study, <a
    href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6295">On the
    materials basis of modern society</a></li>
    <li>The <a
    href="https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/riskList.html">British
    Geological Survey (BGS) Risk List</a> states that
    economically important metals with high levels of risk to
    supply disruption including antimony (with application as a
    fire retardant), bismuth (used in numerous medical
    applications), platinum group metals (active components in
    auto-catalysts), and tungsten (a key hard metal used in most
    cutting tools), particularly the rare earth elements and
    antimony, have low recycling rates and a limited number of
    substitutes. They are also almost exclusively mined as
    by-product metals.</li>
    <li>The minimum total power that was required to run (wall
    socket power) and maintain (embody) the internet in 2017 was
    guesstimated to be somewhere between ~131 GW + ~167 GW = ~298
    GW and ~204 GW + ~288 GW = ~492 GW.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Surveillance society</h2>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>A government steps in to protect its citizens from
    (potential) dissident and/or criminal actions and/or
    information that might “corrupt” its citizens.</li>
    <li>(Intelligence) Agencies use data-mining to identify
    (potential) individual dissidents and criminals.</li>
    <li>Government steps in to protect its individual citizens’
    privacy from being mined by non-state-actors and to create
    distraction from their own mining activities. Strong privacy
    regulations emerge.</li>
    <li>Citizens are increasingly being targeted in surveillance
    with surveillance tools purchased from China.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Likely effects</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Organisations (Cartels, corporations, companies, NGO’s) are
    restricted in their use of data.</li>
    <li>Consumerism is stifled.</li>
    <li>Governments will try to shift responsibility to individual
    citizens.</li>
    <li>Identity theft and ransomware boom.</li>
    <li>Individual citizens and citizen groups supported by NGO’s
    call for “making the internet more safe (for
    children/women/dissidents)”.</li>
    <li>Governments try to regulate again and surveillance
    increases.</li>
    <li>Companies offering private and protected access to online
    services and make a lot of money.</li>
    <li>Mobile devices are closed and curated.</li>
    <li>Because people need to appear perfect to others, the need to
    appear perfect to oneself increases also (the cognitive
    dissonance is too painful). Acknowledging mistakes and
    failures and the feelings associated with them can be hard.</li>
    <li>The surveillance society makes people have “negative
    emotions”. The positive thinking movement encourages people to
    ignore their negative emotions.
    <ul>
    <li>Negative emotions get buried in subconscious, resulting
    in mood swings, unexplained sadness, and mild depression,
    and eventually in aggression.</li>
    <li>Suppressing negative emotions may lead to depression,
    low self-esteem, and even physical illness in extreme
    cases.</li>
    <li>Suppressing emotions is a risk factor in premature
    death, including death from cancer.</li>
    <li>Negative emotions are dumped elsewhere on innocent
    people. NGO’s will need more funding to respond with
    new/more support for women and children (at home) and
    dissidents (elsewhere).</li>
    <li>Consciously constantly suppressing emotions can cause
    emotional numbness. It is common to hear the phrases “We
    live in stressful times” and “It is what it is” (with a
    shrug) and “You shouldn’t feel this way. Everything is
    alright. You need to be positive.”</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Measurables and observables</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The attack patterns may or may not have to do with
    psychogenic forces and deep states and include
    <ul>
    <li>women and children more targeted more by teensy weensy
    petty tyrants, little petty tyrants and minor petty
    tyrants.</li>
    <li>human rights activists, journalists, land defenders, and
    political dissidents targeted more by petty tyrants.</li>
    <li>identity theft and ransomware attacks happening via
    automated botnets.</li>
    <li>(Intelligence) Agencies increasingly using data-mining
    or bying data from brokers to identify “(potential)
    individual dissidents and criminals”.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The old EU Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated.
    It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud
    computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric
    data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a
    comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to
    strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy.
    Unlike directives, <a href="/gdpr/">the new GDPR</a> that came into force in 2018
    does not require national governments to pass any enabling
    legislation. It is directly binding and applicable.
    <ul>
    <li>Note that the GDPR only addresses privacy concerns
    related to data processing by private sector and not by
    individual Member States. With the internet being a global
    network (driven by established interests), laws regarding
    for example, digital fingerprinting by intelligence
    agencies, may develop completely differently from one
    country to another regardless of raised concerns at the EU
    level as to the compatibility of such activities with
    human rights standards.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interventions by governments</h2>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Corporations, enterprises and NGO’s are targets in this
    scenario.</li>
    <li>A government attempts to regulate the situation in order to
    protect the targets and itself.</li>
    <li>All infrastructure becomes critical.</li>
    <li>The targets are held responsible.</li>
    <li>Attacks are perceived as cyber war events.</li>
    <li>Cyber warfare breaks out.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Likely effects</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Increased cost (capital) for businesses/organisations
    online.</li>
    <li>Increasingly business resources are focused on compliance
    with regulation instead of risk assessments for gaining a
    profit.</li>
    <li>Botnets get taken down.</li>
    <li>More cyber criminals are caught. Opportunity cost for
    private petty tyrants increases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Measurables and observables</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The attack patterns that the (in)famous Equifax (and other) data breaches
    reveal, is one of negligence - only self, no real concern for
    customers/clients/citizens and the context of the internet.
    This <em>invites</em> government regulation while such
    vulnerable products do not invite perceptions of sophisticated
    hacking on infrastructure by other nations and acts of
    cyberwar that call for counterattacks. On the contrary. The
    JP Morgan Chase hack is a prime example of immediately
    perceiving cyberwar after a breach is made known. When
    discovered in 2014, the media were full of articles on Russian
    hackers attacking the U.S. financial system in retaliation
    against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia.
    As it turns out in 2015, it was a “worldwide hacking ring”
    with four members, of which one was an American and two were
    Israeli’s. The fourth remains a mystery. That Aaron, after
    attacking the U.S. Financial system (read “crown jewels”),
    fled to Russia just weeks before the U.S. issued arrest
    warrants for him, and then later negotiated with the U.S. to
    come back home, seems also significant.</li>
    <li>Forming of cyber defence divisions like the NATO Cyber
    defence, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,
    and Cyber Warfare book by Defense One portal</li>
    <li>Emerging infrastructure studies like <a
    href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cyberwar">Harvard:
    Cyber War</a></li>
    <li>Appearance of International Cyberwar Treaties: Calls for
    such treaties, intiatives, frameworks made, and discussions on
    pros and cons, but a treaty like this makes no sense and is
    extremely unlikely to work in practice as governments continue
    to invest millions in developing espionage technology to spy
    on each other, and such targets include allies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Hacker groups rule</h2>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Autonomous collectives, cartel-paid mercenary and
    nation-state-sponsored hacker groups grow, expand and
    escalate.</li>
    <li>Cartels that have the resources to respond with “security
    measures” also grow, expand, and escalate.</li>
    <li>Some cartels establish “safe havens” (fiefdoms) and will
    start charging (a lot) for membership or require more private
    data from its “members” to “cover the costs”.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Likely effects</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Increase in attacks.</li>
    <li>Security costs escalate.</li>
    <li>Aggressive corporate and national cyberespionage.</li>
    <li>Defensive cartels get to set their pricing.</li>
    <li>Supply chain for attackers as well as defenders grows.</li>
    <li>Organisations and cartels build their own counter-attack
    teams.</li>
    <li>Within cartels, attack and defensive information is shared,
    and counter-attack teams collaborate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Measurables and observables</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Attack patterns: more malware infections and advanced
    persistent threats.</li>
    <li>Forming of cartels like the Cyber Threat Alliance and Cloud
    Security Alliance.</li>
    <li>Increased “military speak” in white hat contexts like
    “Critical Security Controls” and “Certified Ethical Hacker”
    (EC-Council funded). Security and privacy campaigning NGO’s
    internally talk about their clients as “target audience”.</li>
    <li>More tools created and gathered in Kali Linux by Offensive
    Security.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self-organising (protection) societies</h2>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>This is a deviant (partly inductive) scenario, at least in
    terms of neoliberal official futures.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Individuals are increasingly targeted by governments and
    (nation-state or autonomous) hacker groups.</li>
    <li>Individuals are increasingly tracked and profiled.</li>
    <li>Government agencies of various sorts use the information to
    discover “dissidents”, “criminals” and “terrorists”.</li>
    <li>Businesses and data market companies use the information to
    influence the emotions and behaviour of individuals.</li>
    <li>Ineffective regulation.</li>
    <li>E-militias form.</li>
    <li>GNU licensed federated social media where users can operate
    safely within protective boundaries flourish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A possible response of cartels is that they form their own
    protection societies for customers. Walled gardens providing
    anonymity and safety, with steep pricing. A possible response by
    governments is sicking armies of infiltrators (which may be
    sophisticated MLM bots) at citizens in the self-organised and
    corporate run gardens.</p>
    <h3>Likely effects</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Corporate reputations take a nose-dive, and so does
    “consumer” trust.</li>
    <li>Bubbles of like-minded people grow (not to be mistaken for
    filter-bubbles where an algorithm decides what’s in and out of
    an individual’s bubble). They trade, collaborate and converse
    between themselves. Trade between groups only happens for
    mutual beneficial actions or after sufficient trust levels
    have been established.</li>
    <li>Inequality grows.</li>
    <li>In low-income bubbles, E-commerce drops to an all-time low.
    So does consumerism to a certain extent. This is also due to
    extremely low incomes, often way below the poverty line.</li>
    <li>Darknet grows.</li>
    <li>The desire for anonymity grows.</li>
    <li>Differences get slugged out between individuals and between
    groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Measurables and observables</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Appearance of federated GNU licensed self-organising social
    media, tools like Mastodon, Peertube and research like
    Tracking Exposed and Citizen Lab.</li>
    <li>Appearance of articles like <a
    href="https://logicmag.io/failure/freedom-isnt-free/">Freedom
    Isn’t Free, Wendy Liu</a></li>
    <li>Corporate run social media user bases like facebook,
    Twitter, instagram and YouTube expand even further into other
    regions.</li>
    <li>E-commerce growth rate initially explodes, shops in villages
    and smaller cities close.</li>
    <li>(Appearance of) Corporate or government run walled gardens.</li>
    <li>In low-income bubbles, E-commerce did not drop to an all-time low. Most likely due to the COVID lockdowns. People in low incomes bubbles do buy less online. The digital divide is clearly there though, even with governments, organisations, and shops pushing their apps.</li>
    </ul>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
