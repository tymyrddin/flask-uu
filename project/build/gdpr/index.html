    <p>The old Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It
    failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud
    computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric
    data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a
    comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to
    strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy.
    Unlike directives, the GDPR does not require national
    governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly
    binding and applicable.</p>
    <p>All seven principles governing the <a
    href="/oecd-recommendations/">OECD’s
    recommendations for protection of personal data</a> are
    incorporated into the new EU regulation.</p>
    <h2>Personal data</h2>
    <p>Article 4(1) defines “personal data” as follows: <em>‘personal
    data’ means any information relating to an identified or
    identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an
    identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
    directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
    identifier such as a name, an identification number,
    location data, an online identifier or to one or more
    factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
    mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
    natural person;</em></p>
    <p>This definition is broad and fairly all-encompassing. It
    includes any information relating to an identified individual
    (which makes such information personal to that individual), or
    any information relating to someone who could be identified
    based on a variety of identifiers.</p>
    <h2>Controllers and processors</h2>
    <p>Article 4 defines data controllers and data processors as
    follows: <em>(7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal
    person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone
    or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of
    the processing of personal data; where the purposes and
    means of such processing are determined by Union or Member
    State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
    nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</em>
    and <em>(8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which processes
    personal data on behalf of the controller;</em></p>
    <h2>Lawfulness of processing conditions</h2>
    <p>Data processing must be “lawful”, meaning it must be
    justified by a legitimate purpose in order to be permissible.
    For “legitimate interests” the interests that are important to
    a business or organisation are not enough. These conditions
    must include</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Consent of the data subject</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
    with the data subject or to take steps to enter into a
    contract</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of
    a data subject or another person</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a task
    carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
    official authority vested in the controller</li>
    <li>Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued
    by the controller or a third party, except where such
    interests are overridden by the interests, rights or
    freedoms of the data subject.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that this condition is not available to processing
    carried out by public authorities in the performance of their
    tasks.</p>
    <h2>Biometric data</h2>
    <p>It defines biometric data as special categories of personal
    data and prohibits its processing, thereby protecting people
    from having their information shared with third parties
    without their consent.</p>
    <p>Biometric data are: _“personal data resulting from specific
    technical processing relating to the physical, physiological
    or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which
    allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural
    person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data”. _</p>
    <h2>Conditions for processing special categories of data</h2>
    <p>Processing of special categories of data for the purpose of
    "uniquely identifying a natural person" is prohibited, but it
    contains some exceptions.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Explicit consent of the data subject, unless reliance on
    consent is prohibited by EU or Member State law</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for carrying out obligations under
    employment, social security or social protection law, or a
    collective agreement</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of
    a data subject or another individual where the data subject
    is physically or legally incapable of giving consent</li>
    <li>Processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with a
    political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim
    provided the processing relates only to members or former
    members (or those who have regular contact with it in
    connection with those purposes) and provided there is no
    disclosure to a third party without consent</li>
    <li>Processing relates to personal data manifestly made public
    by the data subject</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or
    defence of legal claims or where courts are acting in their
    judicial capacity</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public
    interest on the basis of Union or Member State law which is
    proportionate to the aim pursued and which contains
    appropriate safeguards</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative
    or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity
    of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health
    or social care or treatment or management of health or
    social care systems and services on the basis of Union or
    Member State law or a contract with a health professional</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in
    the area of public health, such as protecting against
    serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high
    standards of healthcare and of medicinal products or medical
    devices</li>
    <li>Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the
    public interest, or scientific and historical research
    purposes or statistical purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The right to be forgotten</h2>
    <p>The Regulation states that consent must be explicit before
    the collection of the data. As in, users must be opted-out by
    default and be provided with an opt-in, instead of default be
    opted-in (often without their knowledge) and then have to
    search for an opt-out. Also, “the data subject shall have the
    right to withdraw his or her consent at any time”.​
    Data breaches must be notified within 72 hours</p>
    <p>If a company or organisation discovers a data breach, then
    processors must inform the authorities within 72 hours of
    discovery. Companies managing biometric information can be hit
    with penalties if they do not make efforts to secure that
    data. Big penalties.</p>
    <h2>Data protection by design and by default</h2>
    <p>The Article 25 Data Protection by Design (DPbD) seeks to
    embed privacy protection at every level from conception to
    deployment. DPbD is not only about technological design. It
    extends to IT systems, accountable business practices, and
    physical design and networked infrastructure. This integrated
    approach is “an important factor in avoiding falling into
    techno-centric solutions to a sociotechnical problem.”</p>
    <p>In usual engineering practice, legal issues are considered
    obstacles to be overcome after a novel IT solution has been
    built and is to be rolled out. DPbD uses a reversed approach,
    whereby systems and processes are conceived and developed with
    privacy protection at their core.</p>
    <h2>Legitimate interest</h2>
    <p>Under the old directive that aimed to regulate data
    correlation, not just data collection, it was illegal to
    process personal data without a “legitimate interest”, and
    that legal basis was unavailable to data brokers (Opinion
    06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data
    controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC). Now,
    Recital 47 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) -
    Overriding legitimate interest* states: <em>”[t]he processing
    of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be
    regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest“</em>.</p>
    <p>Can the data industry rely on legitimate interests or is it
    required to obtain consent despite the absence of a
    relationship with the data subjects? Under the GDPR, the legal
    basis for processing personal data requires that the
    processing to be described with specificity in advance.
    Without it, using that data for Big Data Analytics &amp; AI
    produces unlawful results exposing organisations, their
    partners and their customers to legal liability.</p>
    <h2>Anonymised data</h2>
    <p>Recital 26 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Not
    applicable to anonymous data* explicitly states that <em>”The
    principles of data protection should apply to any
    information concerning an identified or identifiable natural
    person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation
    [...] should be considered to be information on an
    identifiable natural person.“</em></p>
    <p>Recital 26 also states that data that has been truly
    anonymised lies outside the scope of the regulation: <em>”The
    principles of data protection should therefore not apply to
    anonymous information, namely information which does not
    relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to
    personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the
    data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This
    Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such
    anonymous information, including for statistical or research
    purposes.“</em></p>
    <p>This means that anonymisation not only offers a more powerful
    means of securing personal data, but also enables the use of
    data for, for example, marketing or analysis purposes without
    violating an individual's data privacy. That is to say, if it
    adequately protects the data.</p>
    <h2>Representation of data subjects</h2>
    <p>Article 80 of the GDPR allows civil-liberties or
    consumer-protection representatives to advocate on behalf of
    the community or public interest.</p>
    <h2>It is a global law</h2>
    <p>Non-EU established organisations will be subject to the GDPR
    where they process personal data about EU data subjects.</p>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
