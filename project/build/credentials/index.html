<p>Some of the most common techniques adversaries use to capture credentials include finding or guessing credentials, and passing or relaying password hashes. And cognitive user burnouts on choosing new passwords ...</p>

<h2>Finding credentials</h2>

<p><a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/ad/en/latest/docs/harvest/lwc.html">Password storage targets on Windows</a> after a compromise include operating system memory, user files such as Excel spreadsheets, powershell history, and email inboxes and sent boxes, and also the Windows Registry, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), Windows Credential Manager, Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS), Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), and sticky notes.</p>

<p>Attackers might try <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/escalation/en/latest/docs/windows/passwords.html">harvesting credentials</a> stored in webserver configuration files and application files, operating system memory, a web browsers' autocomplete history or password manager, hard-coded in applications, and <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/cloud/en/latest/docs/prevent/identify.html#weak-credentials">weak credentials in cloud applications</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/app/en/latest/index.html">Insecure web applications in general</a> can be abused to bypass application access control lists (ACLs) or forge valid tokens.</p>

<p> The two most common ways for an adversary to <b>intercept</b> passwords is via an <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/network/en/latest/docs/box/mitm.html">on-path attack</a>, also known as Man in the Middle (MitM) attack, and via exploiting promiscuous protocols, such as LLMNR and NetBIOS, IPv6, and MDNS. </p>

<p> An example of the first is <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/network/en/latest/docs/access/arp-cache-poisoning.html">poisoning Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables</a> in a network switching device, getting it to forward traffic to an unauthorised port before being forwarded to its intended destination, waiting for a password hash, then pulling the hash offline for cracking it. Promiscuous protocols that can be tricked into sending a password hash to an unvetted recipient can result in a breach if the original password is not long enough and is not difficult to guess. </p>

<h2>Guessing credentials</h2>

<p>Adversaries confronted with a secure web application which does not leak platform, patch or configuration information; with code that protects against injection and scripting attacks; and with strong account access and lockout controls, may try password guessing. Password lockout policies can sometimes be bypassed with <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/cloud/en/latest/docs/roles/spraying.html">password spraying</a>. </p>

<h2>Passing or relaying password hashes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Windows <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/ad/en/latest/docs/breach/ntlm.html">NTLM algorithm</a> algorithm is susceptible to the well-known pass-the-hash attack. </li>
<li>Newer Windows authentication algorithms such as <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/ad/en/latest/docs/pivot/auth.html#ntlmv2-net-ntlmv2-hash">Net-NTLM hashes</a> make use of a one-time challenge. But if message signing is not both enabled and required by every host in the domain, these challenges can be relayed by attackers. Relaying attacks can be done via <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/ad/en/latest/docs/breach/relays.html">cross-protocol relays</a> that use any other protocol that supports Windows Net-NTLM authentication.</li>
<li>Even <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/network/en/latest/docs/ad/kerberos.html">Kerberos authentication</a>, though more secure, can be successfully attacked. In some cases, Kerberos can be abused to impersonate other users within the environment and forge a valid ticket.</li>
</ul>

<p>And social engineering is still one of the most effective ways adversaries can use. <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/projects/fire/en/latest/docs/phishing/phishing.html">Phishing</a>seems to be the most popular choice. These attacks use persuasion techniques such as impersonating technical support personnel, name-dropping a person of authority, communicating a sense of urgency, and using plenty of technical jargon and alphabet soup to confuse users and elicit compliance. "For verification purposes, please give us the code just sent to you."</p>

<h2>Bypassing MFA</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The easiest way to bypass MFA is to social engineer. </li>
    <li>Another way could be to look for configurations that allow authentication that bypasses MFA, like application programming interfaces (APIs) or clients who do not require MFA, such as Exchange Web Services and Exchange Modern Authentication, which can provide a non-2FA-protected backdoor login. </li>
    <li>MFA-protected user accounts may not yet have been set up. For the adversary, time to do so. This is not quiet though, as the original user gets locked out of their account and will sound the alarm. </li>
    <li>A common bypass technique is to use the hashed Windows NTLM password hash to access functionality not protected by MFA.</li>
    <li>And last but not least, MFA systems need a fallback plan, and any weaknesses in a fail-open plan can be exploited.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding biometrics?</h2>

<p>Adding fingerprint on top? FaceID? What if you are sleeping and someone uses your biometrics to unlock the device? What if someone knocks you out? </p>

<h2>Choosing the new password</h2>

<p>Maintaining security demands ever longer, complex passwords with frequent changes, now augmented by installing and using multifactor authentication (MFA), with all passwords encrypted in transit and either encrypted or hashed at rest, and further augmented with biometrics.</p>
<p>People just wish for the simplest access possible instead of having to jump through hoops all the time to keep their PII safe and secure.</p>
<p>This round of cognitive dissonance was on me.</p>

        Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for
            that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a
            papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings. In the silence of the night the
            books talked to one another. <span style="float:right"> <strong>A student</strong></span></p>
