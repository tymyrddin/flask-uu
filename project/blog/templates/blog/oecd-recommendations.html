<p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) is an intergovernmental economic
organisation with 35 member countries, founded in 1961
to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is
a forum of countries describing themselves as
committed to democracy and the market economy,
providing a platform to compare policy experiences,
seeking answers to common problems, identify good
practices and coordinate domestic and international
policies of its members.</p>
<p>It’s recommendations for protection of personal data
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice — data subjects should be given notice when
their data is being collected;</li>
<li>Purpose — data should only be used for the purpose
stated and not for any other purposes;</li>
<li>Consent — data should not be disclosed without the
data subject’s consent;</li>
<li>Security — collected data should be kept secure
from any potential abuses;</li>
<li>Disclosure — data subjects should be informed as
to who is collecting their data;</li>
<li>Access — data subjects should be allowed to access
their data and make corrections to any inaccurate
data</li>
<li>Accountability — data subjects should have a
method available to them to hold data collectors

</ul>
<p>The <a

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> has
incorporated all seven principles. The United States,
while endorsing the recommendations, is not
implementing them.</p>
