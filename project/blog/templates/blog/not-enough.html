    and <a
    href="{{ url_for('blog.posts', blog_title='iccpr') }}">ICCPR</a>
    are not enough, and that is not only because of the tremendous
    struggle to implement their rules. The GDPR for example,
    actually <a

    the entire information industry by making it a <a

    area</a>.</p>
    <p>It came into force May 25 at midnight 2018 and is supposed to
    give users a free choice, whether they agree to data usage or
    not. The opposite feeling spread on the screens of many users:
    tons of “consent boxes” popped up online or in applications,
    often combined with a threat that the service can no longer be
    used if users do not consent. On the first day of GDPR noyb.eu
    filed four complaints against Google (Android), Facebook,
    WhatsApp and Instagram over “forced consent”.</p>
    <p><em>Politics no longer seems to be able to cope with six of
    the greatest challenges of our time: destruction of the
    environment, digitalisation, the power of algorithms,
    systematic lies in politics, unchecked globalisation and
    threats to the rule of law. We all want to live in an
    environment that is healthy and protected. We want to use
    the internet in a way determined by us, without being
    scrutinised and manipulated, we want to be able to trust
    intelligent machines and not be threatened by them. We have
    seen that the prerequisite of our democracy is truth and not
    lies, and we want to end the exploitation of people in a
    globalised world. The old constitutions of Europe have no
    clear answers for the enormous upheavals of recent years.</em>
