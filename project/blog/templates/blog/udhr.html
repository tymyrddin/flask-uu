    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human
    Rights consists of 30 articles
    affirming an individualâ€™s rights
    which, although not legally binding in
    themselves, have been elaborated in
    subsequent international treaties,
    economic transfers, regional human
    rights instruments, national
    constitutions, and other laws. The
    Declaration was the first step in the
    process of formulating the
    International Bill of Human Rights,
    which was completed in 1966, and came
    into force in 1976, after a sufficient
    number of countries had ratified them.</p>
    <p>Some legal scholars have argued that
    because countries have constantly
    invoked the Declaration for more than
    50 years, it has become binding as a
    part of customary international law.
    Courts of several countries have
    concluded that the Declaration is not
    in and of itself part of domestic law.</p>
    <h2>Article 12</h2>
    <p>No one shall be subjected to
    arbitrary interference with his
    privacy, family, home or
    correspondence, nor to attacks upon
    his honour and reputation. Everyone
    has the right to the protection of the
    law against such interference or
    attacks.</p>
    <h2>Article 25</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Everyone has the right to a
    standard of living adequate for the
    health and well-being of himself and
    of his family, including food,
    clothing, housing and medical care
    and necessary social services, and
    the right to security in the event
    of unemployment, sickness,
    disability, widowhood, old age or
    other lack of livelihood in
    circumstances beyond his control.</li>
    <li>Motherhood and childhood are
    entitled to special care and
    assistance. All children, whether
    born in or out of wedlock, shall
    enjoy the same social protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Article 26</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Everyone has the right to
    education. Education shall be free,
    at least in the elementary and
    fundamental stages. Elementary
    education shall be compulsory.
    Technical and professional education
    shall be made generally available
    and higher education shall be
    equally accessible to all on the
    basis of merit.</li>
    <li>Education shall be directed to the
    full development of the human
    personality and to the strengthening
    of respect for human rights and
    fundamental freedoms. It shall
    promote understanding, tolerance and
    friendship among all nations, racial
    or religious groups, and shall
    further the activities of the United
    Nations for the maintenance of
    peace.</li>
    <li>Parents have a prior right to
    choose the kind of education that
    shall be given to their children.</li>
    </ul>
