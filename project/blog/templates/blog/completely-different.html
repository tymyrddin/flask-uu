<p>And when you least expect it, there is a Larch.</p>
<h2>Google Fonts</h2>
<p>The Landgericht München’s third civil chamber in Munich,
found that a website, by including Google-Fonts-hosted font on
its pages, <a
href="https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=3%20O%2017493/20">passed
the unidentified plaintiff’s IP address to Google without
authorization and without a legitimate reason for doing so</a>.
This violates the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Google and Facebook Cookie consent</h2>
<p>CNIL, the French data protection regulator, has <a
href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">issued
fines to Google and Facebook for making it harder to refuse
cookies than to accept them</a>. The CNIL noted that the
websites facebook.com, google.fr, and youtube.com offer a
button allowing the user to immediately accept cookies. But
they do not provide an equivalent solution (button or other
mechanism) enabling the website user to just as easily refuse
the use of these cookies.</p>
<h2>Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF)</h2>
<p>When users visit a website or application for the first time,
an interface (a Consent Management platform or CMP) will pop
up where the user may consent to the collection and sharing of
their personal data, or object to various types of processing
based on the legitimate interests of ad tech vendors. The TCF
facilitates the capture of the users’ preferences which are
then shared with the organisations using the <a
href="https://tymyrddin.github.io/da-threat-model/docs/adversaries/Advertising-eco-systems.html">Open
Real Time Bidding system</a>.</p>
<p>The Belgian data protection authority (APD) determined that
IAB Europe acts as a data controller for the registration of
individual users’ preferences by means of the Transparency and
Consent String, linked to an identified user. As such, it
finds <a
href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=APD/GBA_(Belgium)_-_21/2022">IAB
Europe in violation of the GDPR with its pop-up consent
system</a> which is used by companies to make ads and online
tracking compliant with the GDPR. The decision has
implications for the entire online ad industry, as data
collected through the system must now be deleted.</p>
<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics provides statistics on website traffic.
After receiving complaints from the NOYB association, the CNIL
analysed the conditions under which the data collected through
this service is transferred to the United States. <a
href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers-united-states-cnil-orders-website-manageroperator-comply">The
CNIL considers these transfers illegal</a> and ordered a
French website manager to comply with the GDPR and, if
necessary, to stop using this service.</p>
<p>For Wordpress sites, a good alternative could be <a
