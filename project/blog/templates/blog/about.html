        <h1>About the Unseen University</h1>
        <hr class="light">
        <p>The Unseen University is the premiere school of wizardry in Ankh-Morpork, founded in the year 1282 AM (1 UC) by Alberto Malich the Wise. The official motto of the UU is "Nunc Id Vides, Nunc Ne Vides", loosely translated as "Now you see it, now you don't". The unofficial motto is "η β π", or "Eta Beta Pi" (Eat A Better Pie).</p>
        <p>Its buildings are of ancient stone, and contain many dark, winding corridors and small rooms, far more than the size of the grounds should allow. UU Wizards study magic for many years the hard way. Reading an uncountable number of books, passing hard tests, getting one (or several) of the many degrees available and practicing all day long makes a great wizard. Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a classroom, (Room 3b) that does not exist, a happy arrangement mutually understood and respected by Faculty and students alike.</p>

              <h3>Works with your device</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">Wizards like to use instruments specially made for the purposes of practicing magic. The wizard's staff is a familiar and intuitive example; it stores magic that a wizard can use all at once.</p>

              <h3>Transportation</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">The broomstick is the device for magically enhanced travel favoured by <a href="https://wyrd.netlify.app">witches</a>. <br />While associated with witches, wizards have been known to use them in extremis.</p>

              <h3>Up to Date</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">For surveilling all possible times and spaces of the multiverse, wizards have now advanced to the omniscope which is, sadly, very expensive monetarily to produce and very expensive magically to operate.</p>

              <h3>With Love</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">Wizards usually vie for the top position, the Archchancellor. Being invited in one of the orders, each wizard fights for the higher positions in the order, and fights off other wizards and other orders.</p>
