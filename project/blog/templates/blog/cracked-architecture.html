     <p><em>To put it bluntly, metadata is hidden data that can fuck
    you over. Fuck you over real hard and rough like, savvy? Often
    defined as “data about data,” metadata is information about a
    specific file that’s often included within the file itself but
    that’s often not readily visible or modifiable to the end-user
    when z is viewing the file in the standard application that z
    would typically use to view the file. In other words, metadata
    provides background information about a file. Chances are that
    every document you create, every digital photograph you take,
    every music file you download, and so on, all have little bits
    of metadata which can leak vital information about your
    identity.</em> ~ <a

    <p>Surveillance and censorship go hand in hand, what else would
    surveillance be for other than to keep subjects obedient.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Surveillance is carried out by just about everybody,
        parents, teachers, neighbours, organised private groups,
        corporations and governments, and we are not helpless, we
        can <a
        href="https://github.com/tymyrddin/shiny-shrinkage/blob/master/data/Avoiding-surveillance.md">avoid
        surveillance</a> as best as we can.</li>
        <li>Likewise, censorship can be carried out by everybody as
        well. <a
        href="https://github.com/tymyrddin/shiny-shrinkage/blob/master/data/Circumventing-censorship/">And
        we can try to circumvent censorship</a> as long as we also
        protect ourselves from prying eyes on what we are doing.</li>
    </ul>
